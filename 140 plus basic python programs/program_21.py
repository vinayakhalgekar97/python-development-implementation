# Write a Python Program to Find the Sum of Natural Numbers.
# Natural numbers are a set of positive integers that are used to count and order objects.
# They are the numbers that typically start from 1 and continue indefinitely, including all the
# whole numbers greater than 0. In mathematical notation, the set of natural numbers is often
# denoted as "N" and can be expressed as:
# 𝑁 = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, . . .
