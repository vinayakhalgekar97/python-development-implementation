# Write a Python Program to Print the Fibonacci sequence.

# Fibonacci sequence:
# The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two
# preceding ones, typically starting with 0 and 1. So, the sequence begins with 0 and 1, and
# the next number is obtained by adding the previous two numbers. This pattern continues
# indefinitely, generating a sequence that looks like this:
# 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, and so on.
# Mathematically, the Fibonacci sequence can be defined using the following recurrence
# relation:
# 𝐹(0) = 0 𝐹(1) = 1 𝐹(𝑛) = 𝐹(𝑛 − 1) + 𝐹(𝑛 − 2)𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑛 > 1
