# Write a Python Program to Check Prime Number.
# Prime Numbers:
# A prime number is a whole number that cannot be evenly divided by any other number
# except for 1 and itself. For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13 are prime numbers because they
# cannot be divided by any other positive integer except for 1 and their own value.
