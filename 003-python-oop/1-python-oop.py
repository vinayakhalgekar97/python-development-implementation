Python OOP Concepts
OOP is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects and classes rather than just functions and logic.

Class → blueprint (template) for creating objects.
Object (instance) → real-world entity created from a class.
Attributes (variables) → data stored in objects.
Methods (functions) → behavior defined inside class.

Characteristics of OOP (Object Oriented Programming)
1. Classes
2. Objects
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism
5. Encapsulation
6. Abstraction
