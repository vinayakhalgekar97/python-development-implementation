First Class functions in Python

In Python, functions are treated as first-class objects. This means they can be used just like numbers, strings, or any other variable. You can:
Assign functions to variables.
Pass them as arguments to other functions.
Return them from functions.
Store them in data structures such as lists or dictionaries.
